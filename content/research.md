## Research
My research interests lie in algebraic number theory, particularly in the
p-adic Langlands program.

## Papers
-  On derived deformation rings in characteristic 0 and a conjecture of
    Venkatesh. *Coming soon!* <!--  [[pdf](/files/ddrchar0.pdf)] -->
- On patched completed homology and a conjecture of Venkatesh. [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04228)]
